CLI e-book manger 
Simple python e-book manager. You can give your e-books location and sort them with lists and use it whenever you want.
I dont know why did I made it, I was just bored.
Its benefit is, it use symlink instead of copying the book to somewhere else(I dont know its even a benefit or not).
